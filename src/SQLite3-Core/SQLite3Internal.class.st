"
The SQLITE_INTERNAL result code indicates an internal malfunction. In a working version of SQLite, an application should never see this result code. If application does encounter this result code, it shows that there is a bug in the database engine.

SQLite does not currently generate this result code. However, application-defined SQL functions or virtual tables, or VFSes, or other extensions might cause this result code to be returned.
