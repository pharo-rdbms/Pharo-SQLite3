The SQLITE_MISMATCH error code indicates a datatype mismatch.

SQLite is normally very forgiving about mismatches between the type of a value and the declared type of the container in which that value is to be stored. For example, SQLite allows the application to store a large BLOB in a column with a declared type of BOOLEAN. But in a few cases, SQLite is strict about types. The SQLITE_MISMATCH error is returned in those few cases when the types do not match.

The rowid of a table must be an integer. Attempt to set the rowid to anything other than an integer (or a NULL which will be automatically converted into the next available integer rowid) results in an SQLITE_MISMATCH error.
